# Pointers
* := types which
  * hold memory address of a value
  * ⚠️ are NOT arithmetic ⚠️
    * Note: ≠ C
  * `*`
    * `*T`
      * type of the pointer, whose type of the value is `T`
    * `*pointerValue` = `value` -- "dereferencing" OR "indirecting" —
  * `&i`
    * operand `i` — generates a → pointer of `i`
  * `nil`
    * zero value of a pointer
