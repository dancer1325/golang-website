* Reflection
  * := [in computing] ability of a program / examines its own structure — via — types
    * ⭐ — closely related to — interface type ⭐
      * interface type strict definition must be taken in account  -- NOT as _constraint within polymorphic code_ --
  * == metaprogramming
* Representation of an interface -- Check '../Go Data Structures: Interfaces'
* Go is statically typed
  * == any variable has 1! static type → 1! type / compile time
* First law -- Reflection goes from interface value to reflection object. —
  * TODO:
* `go run reflection.go`
